<h2 class="b18">14. Buying Products</h2>
<div id="sprite2"><hr class="gray2" /></div>
<div id="sprite">
<p><span style="font-size: small;">When you buy a Product, you acquire a license to use that Product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Products are subject to different terms of use &ndash; depending on the type of license that you choose when buying the Product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The different types of licenses (and associated fees) and the conditions of use are set out in the Pricing and Licensing Matrix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Depending on the use you want to make of a Product, you will need to select the correct license required by you. You are responsible for choosing, and warrant that you have chosen, the correct license to meet your requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">If you buy a Product, you do so on the following terms:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">a. you cannot cancel an order for a Product once the order has been submitted;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">b. Site does not give any undertaking as to the continued availability of Products offered for sale on the Sites;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">c. once your order for a Product is accepted, and you pay the fee, you acquire a non exclusive, non transferable license to use the Product in accordance with the conditions of the license that you acquire;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">d. ownership of the Product remains with the Seller;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">e. the Product may not be re-sold by the Buyer; and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">f. payment of the fee will be made at the time of download by deduction from your Member Ledger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">You acknowledge and agree that despite Site&rsquo;s reasonable precautions, Products may be listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to a typographical error or similar oversight. In these circumstances, Site reserves the right to cancel or reverse a transaction, even after your order has been confirmed and a payment has been processed. If a transaction is cancelled, Site will immediately arrange for any payment to be refunded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Due to the digital nature of the Products offered for sale at the Sites, we maintain a &ldquo;no refunds&rdquo; policy for Products which can be previewed by the Buyers (such as audio and graphics). A Buyer may make a claim for refund if a Product is one that cannot be previewed (such as WordPress themes, Adobe After Effect Projects, applications) and the Buyer asserts that the Product is not as described, or is broken or is corrupt. The deadline for a Buyer making any refund claim is 30 calendar days after purchase and this claim must be made to <a class="blue3" href="support">Support</a>. We will verify the validity of the claim before a refund is approved.</span></p>
